# Portfolio [IN PROGRESS]

## About Me
I am an IT enthusiast with strong communication skills, adept at teamwork, and well-organized. My experience includes successfully releasing The Wizards game series across various platforms. As a detail-oriented and diligent individual, I focus on excellence in every aspect of my work. Currently, I am expanding my skills in the field of QA and actively seeking new challenges in the IT industry. I am ready and willing to contribute to projects that demand precision and professionalism.

Outside the IT world, I am involved in an amateur Wind Orchestra at the Volunteer Fire Department in Polanka Wielka, where I serve as a percussionist. This experience teaches me collaboration, harmony, and a passion for music.

Respect for colleagues is paramount in my professional life. I am exploring new opportunities in the QA field and am eager to collaborate with a team that values professionalism and mutual respect.
